### Notes:
- Read [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/docs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before creating the Pull Request. This is a MUST.
- KOSS Documentation is public. Make sure you are not adding any information which should remain private.

**Write path(s) which will be affected by this Pull Request.**
Example:
- `/community/governance`
- `/events/index`
- `/new-section/new-article`

**Justify your changes or addition.**

**Why do you think it should be documented?**

Will sharing this with just the current members serve our purpose? For example, how you plan to conduct an event next week is a private affair. But, how you generally do the event, should be documented.
